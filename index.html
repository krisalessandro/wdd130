        <p>Hello! I am from Guatemala and I am trying to get the applied technology degree here at BYU-I,  </p>
        <p>I love to play tennis; I have been playing tennis since I was eight years old, and now I'm 22, so almost my entire life along with this beautiful sport.
            One thing I love about BYU-I is that the Heavenly Father inspires all the teachers and material, so all I will learn here will prepare me for my future, well-being, and progress. I was born in the Church and just dreamed about one day getting into BYU; I did not realize that it would happen to me right now, so I am grateful for this tremendous opportunity.</p>

            <p>Guatemala, a country in Central America, is a land of diverse landscapes and rich 
                cultural heritage. Bordered by Mexico to the northwest, Belize to the northeast, Honduras to the east, and 
                El Salvador to the south, Guatemala is characterized by its stunning natural beauty, including volcanic mountains, 
                lush rainforests, and picturesque lakes. The vibrant culture of Guatemala is deeply rooted in its Mayan heritage, 
                evident in archaeological sites like Tikal, one of the largest and most well-preserved ancient Mayan cities. The 
                country's colonial history is reflected in its charming cities, such as Antigua Guatemala, known for its well-preserved 
                Spanish Baroque-influenced architecture. Guatemala is also renowned for its colorful indigenous markets, where traditional 
                textiles, crafts, and vibrant textiles showcase the artistry and traditions of the local communities. Despite its cultural 
                richness, Guatemala faces challenges, and efforts are ongoing to promote sustainable development and preserve its unique heritage.
