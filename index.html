        <p>Hello! I am from Guatemala and I am trying to get the applied technology degree here at BYU-I,  </p>
        <p>I love to play tennis; I have been playing tennis since I was eight years old, and now I'm 22, so almost my entire life along with this beautiful sport.
            One thing I love about BYU-I is that the Heavenly Father inspires all the teachers and material, so all I will learn here will prepare me for my future, well-being, and progress. I was born in the Church and just dreamed about one day getting into BYU; I did not realize that it would happen to me right now, so I am grateful for this tremendous opportunity.</p>
